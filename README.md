# NLP Class Project - Named Entity Recognition in E-commerce
Welcome to our NLP class project, where we delve into the fascinating realm of Named Entity Recognition (NER) in the context of e-commerce. This project serves as a vital component of our NLP coursework, guided by Professor JD Osborne.

## Project Overview
Our project focuses on addressing a real-world NLP challenge by applying Named Entity Recognition (NER) to e-commerce data. We are inspired by eBay's Annual University Challenge and aim to bring the practical application of NER to the forefront.

## The Challenge
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a fundamental NLP task that plays a vital role in various language understanding tasks. This challenge is tailored to eBay's unique setting and involves applying NER specifically to eBay listing titles. Examples of NER labeling in listing titles may include identifying brand names, product names, and other relevant information.

The challenge revolves around accurately extracting and labeling aspects within the dataset of item titles. An interesting aspect of this challenge is that not all titles contain the same aspects, making it a puzzle to determine which aspect is present in a given title.

## Dataset
Our dataset comprises 10 million randomly selected, unlabeled item titles from eBay Germany, all related to "Athletic Shoes" categories. Within this dataset, we have 10,000 labeled item titles, indicating that aspects have been successfully extracted.

These labeled item titles are divided into three categories:

Training set (5,000 records)
Quiz set (2,500 records)
Test set (2,500 records)
The training set includes aspects for each item title, while the quiz set does not. Both sets are used for leaderboard scoring. The complete 10 million title dataset, along with the training and quiz sets, will be made available when the project commences.

The test set is vital for determining the winners of the project. It will only be distributed to the top-scoring teams after the project's completion. Similar to the quiz set, aspects will not be provided for the test set.
